# Build a Chatbot to Analyze PDF Document using LLM

This project focuses on leveraging prompt engineering techniques to develop a chatbot powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) for analyzing PDF documents. By applying clear instructions, examples, and keywords, along with strategies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting and Generated Knowledge Prompting, the chatbot efficiently extracts insights from PDFs. It underscores the importance of prompt engineering in enhancing chatbot performance, enabling accurate sentiment analysis, and optimizing productivity in business contexts. Additionally, it introduces the Langchain library, providing robust tools for prompt engineering tailored to LLMs like ChatGPT.
